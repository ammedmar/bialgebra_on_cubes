# Algebraic E_infinity bialgebra on cubes

In this notebook we implement a natural $E_\infty$-bialgebra structures on the chains of the standard infinite cube using the finitely presented $E_\infty$-prop of [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00854). This natural bialgebra induces an $E_\infty$-algebra structure on the cochains of any cubical set.
