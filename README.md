# Algebraic E_infinity bialgebra on cubes

In this notebook we implement natural E_infinity bialgebra structures on the chains of standard cubes using the finitely presented E_infinity prop of [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00854). These natural bialgebras induce an E-infinity coalgebra structure on the chains of any cubical set.
